# Matter-Dimensions
A recreation of antimatter dimensions but insanely bad

Im going to write a bit of info on how things work in this game!

Matter Dimensions:
These are used to produce your first matter and when you buy 10 of each dimension, the dimension gets a x2 boost.

Dimension Multipliers:
These are the multipliers shown right beside the cost of the dimentions, they don't boost the amount of dimensions you get but instead it multiplies matter gain.

Dimension Boost:
Gives a 2x boost to dimensions and unlocks the next dimension (until the 8th dimension, the 9th one is illegal) and the price starts at 20 and then starts increasing by 20 after you unlock the 8th dimension (may need to nerf)

Dimensional Fusion:
Gives a 5x boost to dimensions and thats it, it costs 10 dimension boosts and increases by 5 each purchase.

Infinity:
You can reach it but nothing yet...
